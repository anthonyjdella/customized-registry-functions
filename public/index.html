    <h1>Welcome to my custom site which is hosted on Firebase!</h1>
    <div>This site will convert your resume (in JSON format) to a resume with beautiful themes.</div>

    <div>Hit /{your-github-username} and it will search GitHub for a gist under that account name, called resume.json. If found, it will validate the JSON based on a schema and then display your resume.</div>

    <div>You can change the theme of the resume by hitting /{your-github-username}?theme={name-of-theme}.</div>
