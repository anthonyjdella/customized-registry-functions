# Customized Registry Functions

üñºÔ∏è This is custom registry based on the [JSON Registry](https://github.com/jsonresume/registry-functions). That project is using their own Firebase project and a specific JSON schema. Since I customized my own schema, I want to be able to use this with a registry.
